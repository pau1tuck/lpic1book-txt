## LPIC 1 study guide in plain English

This book is originally released as a part of a series of free video tutorials for LPIC1 created by Jadi \(in Persian language\). But it is also possible to use it as a reference for self-study to prepare for LPIC1-101 & LPIC-102 exam.

I have decided to move this book to its own home at [https://linux1st.com](https://linux1st.com) Please find the latest version there. 

Enjoy!
