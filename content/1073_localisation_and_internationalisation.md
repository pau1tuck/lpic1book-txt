Candidates should be able to localise a system in a different language than English. As well, an understanding of why LANG=C is useful when scripting.

### Key Knowledge Areas

* Configure locale settings and environment variables.
* Configure timezone settings and environment variables.

### Terms and Utilities

* /etc/timezone
* /etc/localtime
* /usr/share/zoneinfo/
* LC\_\*
* LC\_ALL
* LANG
* TZ
* /usr/bin/locale
* tzselect
* timedatectl
* date
* iconv
* UTF-8
* ISO-8859
* ASCII
* Unicode

### timezone

On linux systems you can use `date` and `cal` commands to check the date and the calendar. It is possible to print a custom date using `+` formatter:

```text
[jadi@funlife ~]$ date +'%Y%m%d-%M'
20160103-39
[jadi@funlife ~]$ date +'%Y%m%d-%H%M'
20160103-2239
```

Timezone determines what is your time difference comparing with a reference timezone. This way you can talk about times regardless from your location. In another words, I can tell you "start the change request at 02:30 UTC" we both know when the change will be started in our own timezone \(mine is 02:30 minus 3:30\).

You can configure your timezone while installing the system or by using a GUI in the system settings. It is even possible to set the timezone by clicking or right-clicking on the date and time on your panel. But as always there is a command line way. The old one used to be `tzconfig` but it is not used anymore.

Different distros do have their own configuration commands, a general one is:

```text
tzselect
Please identify a location so that time zone rules can be set correctly.
Please select a continent, ocean, "coord", or "TZ".
 1) Africa
 2) Americas
 3) Antarctica
 4) Arctic Ocean
 5) Asia
 6) Atlantic Ocean
 7) Australia
 8) Europe
 9) Indian Ocean
10) Pacific Ocean
11) coord - I want to use geographical coordinates.
12) TZ - I want to specify the time zone using the Posix TZ format.
```

This process will suggest you to set a variable called `TZ` as follow to set _your own_ time zone, but not the systems:

```text
TZ='Asia/Tehran'; export TZ
```

### Configuring timezone

There is a directory at `/usr/share/zoneinfo/` containing all the timezone info. These are binary files. If you need to change your systems timezone you need to change 2 files:

```text
cat /etc/timezone
Asia/Tehran
```

and there is a short link at this place:

```text
# ls -ltrh /etc/localtime
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.7K Jan  2 18:10 /etc/localtime
```

This file should be replaced by the correct file from `/usr/share/zoneinfo/`. It is nicer to make a symbolic link rather than copying the actual file. This will prevent the conflicts during next upgrades.

### Configuring Languages

You can check the status of current selected system language by issuing `locale`:

```text
$locale
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=
LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=
```

These are all environment variables telling system what languages to use. Here I'm using `LANG=en_US.UTF-8` which means I'm using English with US variant and UTF-8 encoding.

> UTF-8 and other encodings will be discussed a bit later in this chapter

Other variables tell the system how to show different things based on localisation systems. For example if we change the LC\_TIME to "en\_GB.UTF-8" the time will be printed in Great Britain format from that moment on.

Another important settings is `LC_ALL`. It can be used to change **ALL** settings. If you do a `export LC_ALL=fa_IR.UTF-8`, all the settings will be set to that one, with no exception. It is always possible to `unset LC_ALL`.

#### LANG=C

Another important point to know is the `LANG=C` settings. This indicates two things:

1. All language settings will be default \(en.US\)
2. Binary sort order

It is also possible to do a LC\_ALL=C.

#### changing or adding locales

This is not a part of LPIC exam but it is good to know that on a debian based machine, you can change, add or set your default _locales_ using `dpkg-reconfigure locales`.

### Character Encoding

#### ACSII

Computers used to work with 7bit characters encoding. That would give us 128 characters which was enough for numbers, punctuation and digits!

#### ISO-8859

It had more characters and a lots of sets for Thai, Arabic and other languages but still had ASCII character sets.

#### UTF-8

The `Unicode Transformation Format` is the newest encoding method. It is a real universal encoding with characters not only for all written languages but also for fun characters like ¾, ♠, π and ⚤. It is backward compatible with the ASCII and uses 8 bit code units \(**not 8 bit coding!**\). In most cases it is a good idea to use UTF-8 and be sure that your system will work in practically all cases.

![Unicode Grow](../.gitbook/assets/UnicodeGrow.png)

Above table shows how UTF8 is the leader compared with ASCII and ISO-8859.

### iconv

If you needed to convert coding to each other, the command is `iconv`. The `-l` switch will show you all the available codings:

```text
iconv -f WINDOWS-1258 -t UTF-8 /tmp/myfile.txt
```

> Note: -f is for "from" and -t is for "to". Easy to remember

In 2016 you will seldom need this command but it is a must to know it, specially if you are living in a non US country!
